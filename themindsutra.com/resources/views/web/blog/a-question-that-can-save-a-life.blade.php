                <p>In Leo Tolstoy's famous novel, 'The Death of Ivan Ilyich' the narrative centers on Ivan Ilyich's struggle with a terminal illness. His struggle forces him to confront the inevitability of his own death. He asks a question as he has his accountant from Moscow lying on his deathbed,”What if my whole life had been wrong?”If only we spend some time with ourselves, while we have it and decipher our purpose of life and look deeper into our actions, we wouldn't have the dilemma that Ivan had at his deathbed.</p>
                <h3>Why did I start it in the first place?</h3>
                <p>Roger Federer inspires all with his sheer love for the game. He just cannot imagine his life without tennis. He had shared – “Sometimes you're just happy playing. Some people, some media, unfortunately, don't understand that it's okay just to play tennis and enjoy it. They always think you have to win everything, it always needs  to be a success story, and if it's not, obviously, what is the point? Maybe you have to go back and think, ‘why have I started playing tennis? Because I just like it. It's actually sort of a dream hobby that became somewhat of a job. Some people just don't get that, ever.</p>
                <h3>Truth or kindness?</h3>
                <p>We must let the basic truth of who we are inspire and guide us . Rumi, the persian poet, expressed this beautifully in his poem, “Saying Yes Quickly,” which says</p>

                        <p><i>Inside you</i></p>
                        <p><i>there's an artist you don't know about.</i></p>
                        <p><i>If you've opened your loving to God's love</i></p>
                        <p><i>you're helping people you don't know and have never seen.</i><br/><br/></p>
                        <p><i>Is what I say true? Say yes quickly,</i></p>
                        <p><i>if you know, you've known it</i></p>
                        <p><i>from the beginning of the universe.</i></p>

                <p>Till our inner values and self expression align with a society's or group's ideals and identity, we feel loved and accepted. The conflict arises when our ‘Satya’ or true values are not aligned with a society’s, organisation’s or group’s values. This conflict is called moral dissonance and it can hurt us. It not only affects our happiness, satisfaction and growth, it can lead to anxiety, depression and an array of mental and physical ailments.</p>
                <p>Patanjali himself puts non-violence above the truth in the Yoga Sutras, because he considered it more important and this in other words means that if the truth might lead to violence, then in this case we should avoid violence. Is our truth coming from a dark place in our hearts or from light and kindness-We must tell the truth, but when it is hard we must be careful not to put it abruptly.</p>
                <h3>To bee or not to bee?</h3>
                <p>A bee settling on a flower has stung a child. And the child is afraid of bees and declares that bees exist to sting people. A poet admires the bee sucking from the chalice of a flower and says it exists to suck the fragrance of flowers. A beekeeper, seeing the bee collect pollen from flowers and carry it to the hive, says that it exists to gather honey. Another beekeeper who has studied the life of the hive more closely says that the bee gathers pollen dust to feed the young bees and rear a queen, and that it exists to perpetuate its race. A botanist notices that the bee flying with the pollen of a male flower to a pistil fertilizes the latter, and sees in this the purpose of the bee's existence. Another, observing the migration of plants, notices that the bee helps in this work, and may say that in this lies the purpose of the bee. But the ultimate purpose of the bee is not exhausted by the first, the second, or any of the processes the human mind can discern. The higher the human intellect rises in the discovery of these purposes, the more obvious it becomes, that the ultimate purpose is beyond our comprehension.</p>
                <p>A bee, a flower, a bird lives its truth to the fullest. But we humans have the ability to question, suppress, disapprove of our truth. We also have the ability to find, align and rejoice in our existential truths.  Only Humans can question their truths. Mahatma Gandhi did so when he was thrown out of a train in South Africa because he was a coloured man. Was color discrimination a truth that he should live by? This questioning sowed the seeds of the freedom movement in India.</p>
                <h3>Why do I even exist ?</h3>
                <p>Muniba Mazari questioned the truth of her existence with a fractured spine, no bowel or bladder movements, no chance to bear a baby, confined to a wheelchair for the rest of her life. “Why do I even exist?”, she questioned. To which her mother replied, “This too shall pass. God has greater plans for you. I don’t know what they are but God does.”Muniba held on to these words and her life changed as she asked her brothers for a paint brush and started to paint from her deathbed in the hospital.</p>
