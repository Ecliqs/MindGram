                <p>A friend, who is pure hearted and always there to help whoever may be in need recently told me this story. Recently, when he had planned a sudden visit with his daughter to Chandigarh, he found himself wondering where he should go for dinner after finishing their dayâ€™s work. As he looked around, he found there was an air force base facing the opposite side of the road. He called a friend wondering if he would know someplace to eat there. Within 10 minutes of his call, he received a call from a person who invited him to his home-sharing that he had stayed alone at home and would love to have him over for the night. They had a lavish dinner at the air force canteen and met as old friends. His trip till the drop at the airport was entirely taken care of by this newfound friend. This experience only reiterated his previous knowledge that if you trust the Universe and are constantly communicating with it, it responds to all your needs in amazingly creative ways.</p>
