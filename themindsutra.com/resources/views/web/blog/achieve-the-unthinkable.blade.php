                <p>The Trust Equation, as described by Charles Green , uses four objective variables to measure trustworthiness (T). These four variables are best described as: Credibility ( C) , Reliability (R) , Intimacy (I) and Self-Orientation (S).</p>
                <p>He combines these variables into the following equation: <b>T= (C+R+I) / S</b></p>
                <p>Trusting is not only about believing in others but also about believing in ourselves and believing in the Universe. In the movie The Matrix actor, Keanu Reeves, plays the character Neo. He changes the way he thinks about himself. He goes from being a skeptic about his own capabilities to become a true believer that even the unthinkable is doable. Purity is about being a "believing Neo" - a super force beyond our wildest dreams. If we could just be simple enough to believe in this power within us, we could achieve the unthinkable.</p>
