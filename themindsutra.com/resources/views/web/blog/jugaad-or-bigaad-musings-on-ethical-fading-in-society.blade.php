                <p>During the pandemic, older college kids with online classes had wireless ear plugs which were covered by their hair. This would help them hide the group chat that happened while the exam was on. So though they were giving exams in front of the laptop with their cameras aimed at them, to confirm they were not cheating, the entire group would hear the answers and give their exams.</p>
                <p>The kids probably were not even sensitized to the kind of unethical practice they were into. The ethical laziness has crept so deeply into our system that it often gets celebrated in the name of ‘jugaad’. Do we even realize the implications on the society as a whole of this ethical fading of boundaries?</p>
                <p>Drawing a line between Jugaad and Bigaad and not being a part of 'chalta hai!' ethical fading  is the real wisdom of Yog and psychology.</p>
