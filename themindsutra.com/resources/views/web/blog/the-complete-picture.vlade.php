                <p>When I came down to Ahmedabad two decades back, I loved the city. I adjusted well to the warm people and my college life. But as years passed by, I found the absence of fluency in the local language a constraint in building deeper friendships. Although I tried hard to belong, something seemed amiss and the lack of belonging and stimulation were gnawing on me.</p>
                <p>My husband showed me the beautiful aspects of the city and the advantages of settling down in the new city and encouraged me to receive life with open arms instead of resisting it as that would only make things tougher for me. As I accepted the peaceful city and its people at a deeper level as my own and identified it as my lifetime home it brought many subtle changes in my life. I now had genuine friends and we connected at many levels. My joy helped me get acquainted with wonderful people with whom I  could bond on my other interests as well.</p>
                <p>Suddenly, I was grateful for the way the whole new world had opened up for me. I discovered that I was happier and more peaceful when I had accepted what had happened instead of constantly fighting to change things.</p>
