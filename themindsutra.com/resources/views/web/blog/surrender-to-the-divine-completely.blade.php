                <p>While we were writing this chapter, Meghna underwent a caesarian section. This was a complicated Cesarean section as she had placenta previa, gestational diabetes with the previous Cesarean section. They had planned the C- section with senior surgeons. However, since she had mild labour pains late at night, they planned the C- section with the available doctors late at night. The previous C- section had a lot of blood loss and she had a rare blood group. She called me up the next day saying she knew the Universe had orchestrated everything and was taking care of the smallest details. It was a smooth cesarean section and she had an amazing post op experience in spite of ongoing pandemic and no help available.</p>
                <p>When we surrender completely to the Universe , the Universe takes care of our smallest desires, in seemingly adverse circumstances.</p>
                <p>Looking back, I realize that there are times when all of us make decisions in that attitude of complete surrender. When we surrender to the Divine completely, the dots connect as we move along and we realize that it was probably the best thing that happened to us.</p>
