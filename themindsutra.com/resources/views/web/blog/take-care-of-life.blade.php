                <p>'You don't know what shall happen in the moment, so why hoard / worry about tomorrow.' is Harishbhai life's motto.</p>
                <p>I met Harishbhai when I was working at the Red Cross. He would come as a donor to donate blood. Always full of energy and a smile on his face, wanting to help and very upright.  At that time, I had not known the degree of surrender he lived by. He has donated blood over 250 times and has done plasma donation too. He has arranged over 15000 camps and is forever helping people and friends with any kind of support that he needs. He is the point of contact for any blood donation needed in the city. He has never been there when it is the time for acknowledgment or prizes. He never worked for himself.</p>
                <p>You don't know what shall happen in the moment, so why hoard / worry about tomorrow.</p>
                <p>As the culture runs in the family, his kids are always ready to help and have grown up to be very polite, proactive and happy kids. He is happy and secure and has never saved for the future and knows that Life takes care of him.</p>
