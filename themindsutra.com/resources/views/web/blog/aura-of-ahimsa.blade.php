                <p>Here's what happened when Buddha encountered a dangerous dacoit.</p>
                <p>Angulimala, according to an old lore, was so named (Anguli = finger , Mala= garland) because he wore a garland of little fingers of all he looted and killed around his neck. He had 999 little fingers around his neck and was looking out for his 1000th victim. Hiding behind the tree in the forest, Angulimala  spotted Buddha coming towards him. He rushed behind Buddha , but somehow Buddha continued to stay a little ahead.</p>
                <p>Angulimala screamed at Buddha to stop.The story goes that Buddha turned calmly and with neither anger nor fear, told Angulimala that He, the Buddha, had already stopped long ago. He had stopped all violence and now it was time for him, Angulimala, to do likewise.Stuck by the peace he felt on hearing Buddha, the dacoit did the most unexpected thing. He followed Buddha to the monastery and became a monk.</p>
                <p>We carry our peaceful vibrations with us. When we are at peace, we influence others around us to act peacefully, as Buddha influenced.</p>
                <p>Developing these vibrations of peace or Aura of Ahimsa is the real art of yoga and science of psychology</p>
