                <p>During the time when I was doing management at ISB, I remember being obsessed by some stray words by my colleague. These would whirl in my head like a permanent merry-go round that never seemed to end. “ Do you think he even remembers that he said these words to you?” my friend had retorted when I shared my anxiety. That's when I realised the futility of my thoughts. Just as a gardener cultivates his plot, keeping it free from weeds, and growing the flowers and fruits which he requires, we need to weed out all the wrong, useless, and impure thoughts, and cultivate the flowers and fruits of right, useful, and pure thoughts as  James Allen extols in his book, “As a Man Thinketh".</p>
