                <p>An older relative of mine lost her husband a few years back.He had the central axle around which her life revolved. Suddenly , with him gone and kids in the US , she felt a sudden vacuum. All of us wondered what turn her life would take now. It was amazing to see her move out of her cocoon in the next few months and reconnect with people around her. She took it upon her to distribute food to the watchmen in her society and feed the kids society with their favourite sweets in the evenings. .A few months later, I heard she had started learning classical music and was conducting music classes for the young kids in her area. The way she adapted herself to the changed circumstances inspired me and all those who meet her now.</p>
                <p>It is very similar to crossing a road with heavy traffic on it. Santosha invites us to stop, take stock of the situation and as soon as the traffic gives way , move ahead towards our goal. Acceptance lets us take stock of the situation around us so that we can navigate through the chaos around us and then arrive at a place of abundance.</p>
