                <p>Depending on our preferences, it can range from inches to feet and varies with situations, upbringing and culture. Most Americans need an arms-length bubble around them. Second, personal space refers to the border that guards your physical and psychic privacy. You have violated it by barging in on your spouse when he or she needs to be alone. Other types of violations can include sound, odors, sneezing on someone if you have a cold, or cyber intrusions such as spam. You can also intrude into someone's property or turf, a breach that can ignite gang violence or wars between nations.</p>
                <p>To better understand your own needs about personal space, and to reduce stress, be aware of the following triggers.</p>
                <p>Microsoft was accused of making it difficult for consumers to uninstall internet explorer and  install competing software on computers operated by Windows.</p>
                <p>Bill Gates probably didn't want himself to become or be remembered as someone who would destroy others or crush innovations for the sake of monopolistic power.</p>
                <h3>Asteya</h3>
                <p><i>This social comparison theory is something psychiatrist Samantha Boardman discussed on her blog."It is a theory predicated on the idea that we determine our own social and personal worth based on how we measure up to others," Boardman says. "In other words, in the absence of objective means of evaluation, we are constantly evaluating ourselves :our intelligence, our attractiveness, wealth, success, etc.—in reference to those around us….Rather than making comparisons to people who are in the same boat as we are, we now have a global landscape to draw from," Boardman says. "Mass media is one of the commanding influences today for social comparison, and studies show it takes a toll on our well-being. Research has found that women who report frequently comparing themselves to other women, especially women in the media, are more likely to show signs of negative mood and body image disturbances. Women participants' brief exposure to media images of females led to increased levels of body dissatisfaction and weight anxiety." When we govern ourselves through the practice of Asteya,it could mean not comparing ourselves to others. Comparing yourself to the other may lead to feeling envious, jealous and therefore stealing from the other their glory.</i></p>
                <p>Lack, insecurity, wanting, feeling 'incomplete'. Essentially it all boils down to feeling like there's something missing. That is just one of the traps our mind does to us. The obsession has gone from the number of likes and so the validation they get from friends; to the number of friends/followers they have on social media. This has been termed as 'facebook envy'.</p>
                <p>In this regard, the advent of social media has radically changed the way the world communicates with each other today. It has also created a vacuum in our lives for which habits, rituals and addictions have evolved. You may not realise this, but</p>
                <p><i>"Jaa, Simran, jaa. Jee le apni zindagi"</i></p>
                <p>This has to be the most iconic dialogue in 'Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge'. When Amrish Puri aka Babuji tells Kajol that she can go live her life as she pleases, doesn't it just make your heart flutter? While the fate of the two lovebirds initially hung uncertain, babuji took us by surprise when he said, "Ja Simran Ja" from the film 'Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge.'</p>
                <p>It is this feeling of complete freedom that we all long for within , to let go , to live in gay abandon that makes our heart flutter.</p>
                <p><i>“One who is trustworthy, because he does not covet what belongs to others, naturally has everyone's confidence and everything is shared with him, however precious it might be.”</i> - <b>TKV Desikachar, Heart of Yoga</b></p>
                <p>In the book 'Ethics for A level', Mark Dimmock, Andrew Fisher share the following scenarios of stealing.</p>
                <p>For example, we might wonder if it is possible to steal an item even though the owner has given you consent to take it. The original definition would rule this out as a conceptual impossibility, but consider someone who, whilst inebriated (perhaps even drugged against their will), gives you permission to take an item of value from their house. Even though you have their explicit permission, acting on this verbal instruction and stealing their television still might seem to be an act of theft.</p>
                <p>As a second counterexample to the original definition, imagine that you are better at cards than someone else, although you hide this fact from them. If you play a game for real money, and beat them hand after hand after hand, might it be suggested that you have stolen their money even though they freely entered into the game?</p>
                <p>There are responses to these two examples, of course. We might deny that either is an act of stealing, or deny that proper consent was ever given — this seems particularly compelling in the first example. However, we can also cast doubt on the definition by focussing not on the issue of consent, but on the idea of property. For example, if a person is being paid by the hour, but spends an undue amount of time on social media or checking sports scores, have they stolen money or time from their employer? Or, as a second possible example, if I make up a joke that is then retold by someone else, have they stolen “property” without my consent? This is a genuinely important issue in the field of comedy, for example. Again, the original definition might be defensible as a mechanism for capturing such instances of stealing. However, if it is defensible, it is only because of a broad reading of the idea of property, taking the concept far beyond the physical.</p>
                <p>Finally, consider the example of someone who fails to pay their legally due portion of tax to the government. Again, we might wonder if this person has “stolen” money just by refusing to hand over their financial property. If so, our reading of the original definition of stealing would again need to be rather broad.</p>
                <p>All of this has hopefully opened your minds to the variety of acts that may or may not be labelled as stealing.</p>
