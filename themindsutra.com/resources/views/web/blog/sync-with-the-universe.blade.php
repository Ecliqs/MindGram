                <p>There are two Jasmine  plants of different species on different floors in my house . One has long thin dense petals , the other shorter petals . They had stopped flowering sometime last year. In this last week of March  around the same time , both of them had beautiful fragrant flowers on them. That really took me by surprise. They had no way to keep a track on the calendar  or were obviously not anxious that they would miss the date or the time to bloom ... being so completely in sync with the Universe , they knew exactly when it was their time to bloom . This is also the way the Universe works with us ... When we are in sync with the Universe , we automatically perform actions so that we bloom to our highest potential</p>
