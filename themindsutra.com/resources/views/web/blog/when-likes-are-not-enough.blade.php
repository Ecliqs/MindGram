                <p>Gurudev Sri Sri Ravi Shankar says, “Sometimes we should get out of our comfort zones, then the abilities in us dawn”. When we chase our infinite potential, we are also able to uplift the people around us and help make this world a better place. Let's not steal those opportunities away from people and the world!</p>
                <p>Numerous studies have found that people who spend just a few minutes per week practicing gratitude by focusing on the good things in their lives (what they have) tend to be the happiest and most satisfied. While social comparison is all about the denominator because it directs our attention to what we want, gratitude is all about the numerator because it directs our attention to what we have.</p>
                <p>We adapt to things we acquire like wealth, education, or accomplishments. 'The common denominator of happiness has a lot to do with the denominator itself (of the happiness formula). The happiest people craft lives that ensure that what they want doesn't get larger than what they have ( This is 'santosha', one of the niyama). It’s not that they keep their wants or expectations needlessly low, but they do keep them realistic and they revise them when necessary with a sense of gratitude. In all cases, you’ll be keeping your denominator low and your numerator high.' shares Tim Bono.completely and become a true master of our lives.</p>
                <p>Here was research on gratitude.</p>
                <p>Two psychologists, Dr. Robert A. Emmons of the University of California, Davis, and Dr. Michael E. McCullough of the University of Miami, have done much of the research on gratitude. In one study, they asked all participants to write a few sentences each week, focusing on particular topics.</p>
                <p>One group wrote about things they were grateful for that had occurred during the week. A second group wrote about daily irritations or things that had displeased them, and the third wrote about events that had affected them (with no emphasis on them being positive or negative). After 10 weeks, those who wrote about gratitude were more optimistic and felt better about their lives. Surprisingly, they also exercised more and had fewer visits to physicians than those who focused on sources of aggravation.</p>
                <p>Another leading researcher in this field, Dr. Martin E. P. Seligman, a psychologist at the University of Pennsylvania, tested the impact of various positive psychology interventions on 411 people, each compared with a control assignment of writing about early memories. When their week's assignment was to write and personally deliver a letter of gratitude to someone who had never been properly thanked for his or her kindness, participants immediately exhibited a huge increase in happiness scores. This impact was greater than that from any other intervention, with benefits lasting for a month.</p>
                <p>Of course, studies such as this one cannot prove cause and effect. But most of the studies published on this topic support an association between gratitude and an individual's well-being.</p>
                <p>Other studies have looked at how gratitude can improve relationships. For example, a study of couples found that individuals who took time to express gratitude for their partner not only felt more positive toward the other person but also felt more comfortable expressing concerns about their relationship.</p>
                <p>Managers who remember to say "thank you" to people who work for them may find that those employees feel motivated to work harder. Researchers at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania randomly divided university fund-raisers into two groups. One group made phone calls to solicit alumni donations in the same way they always had. The second group — assigned to work on a different day — received a pep talk from the director of annual giving, who told the fund-raisers she was grateful for their efforts. During the following week, the university employees who heard her message of gratitude made 50% more fund-raising calls than those who did not.</p>
                <p>There are some notable exceptions to the generally positive results in research on gratitude. One study found that middle-aged divorced women who kept gratitude journals were no more satisfied with their lives than those who did not. Another study found that children and adolescents who wrote and delivered a thank-you letter to someone who made a difference in their lives may have made the other person happier — but did not improve their own well-being. This finding suggests that gratitude is an attainment associated with emotional maturity.</p>

                <p>'Gratitude is a great way to start a day. Gratitude takes you in the direction of love. Practicing gratitude helps you create a loving awareness for your life and yourself. Gratitude expands your awareness and helps you suspend your judgement.</p>
                <p>Gratitude brings you back to now. It aligns your perspective to the abundance in your life and brings a new awareness. It opens your eyes and you see the world differently,' says Louis Hay in Life Loves You.</p>
