                <p>The story of Savitri and Satyavan, in Indian mythology, is about a legendary couple, known for their love and devotion to each other. Savitri is a personification of beauty and purity. According to the legend, princess Savitri marries an exiled prince named Satyavan, who was prophesied to die early. The later part of legend focuses on how Savitri, because of her purity and love , manages to bring her husband back from Yama, the Lord of death.</p>
                <p>Shaucha means Pure. Being ourselves, being honest and transparent, basically at ease with ourselves. As we see in the legend, purity has a power which wins over the Universe.</p>
