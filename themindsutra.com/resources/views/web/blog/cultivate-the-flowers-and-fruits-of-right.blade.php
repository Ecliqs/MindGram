                <p>When we complain about things in life, we erode the trust the Universe has on us and make our life difficult for ourselves. Meghna went through a time in her life when a lot of people around her including friends and family would question her credibility and her ability to complete the MBA course. This was because of the progressive deterioration in vision that she was developing. She had at this time taken an unusual decision of doing an MBA after her fellowship in Ophthalmology. Their comments would disturb her to the point that she started questioning herself. Their words would whirl around her head like a permanent merry-go-round that never seemed to end. Her friend would ask her to confront her negative thoughts and shift her focus on something more meaningful. These thoughts were like weeds which if allowed to grow would not allow her dreams to blossom.  Just as a gardener cultivates his plot, keeping it free from weeds, and growing the flowers and fruits which he requires, we would weed out all the wrong, useless, and impure thoughts, and cultivate the flowers and fruits of right, useful, and pure thoughts as James Allen extols in his book, â€œAs a Man Thinketh".</p>
