                    <h3>Week 1: Relaxation exercises for creativity</h3>
                    <p>You need to look within if you are frittering your energies in excess. We need to take a break from our hectic schedule. Create a relaxed state by breathing deeply, stretching, going for a walk, listening to music or whatever that works for us. Once you feel relaxed, it's possible to find a creative answer to a problem that has been eluding you.</p>
                    <h3>Week 2: Exercise to improve concentration</h3>
                    <p>Body Mind Relaxation: Find a place where you can be alone and undisturbed. Sit with your spine erect. Take a few calm deep breaths, and then relax your body by directing your attention to the sensations in your body and relaxing each muscle from head to toe. Devote 5 minutes to this each day. After one week, you may lengthen the time by 10 minutes.</p>
                    <h3>Week 3: Exercise for Creativity</h3>
                    <p>Genius hour: This exercise for fostering creativity comes from a teacher (Provenzano, 2015) who calls it a 'genius hour'. The idea is to identify a hobby (if we don't have one), start a side project, something you are passionate about. The inspiration, ideas, and skills you develop in this labour of love might well translate to other, more routine projects, moving those forward in positive ways. We will discover new skills as we go along.</p>
                    <h3>Week 4: Exercise for Synchronicity</h3>
                    <p>Connect the Dots : The time we spend with ourselves is the best time for creative inputs. This week and from now on, let's allot a dedicated time when we are with nature or ourselves. Some of the best ideas come to us during these walks with nature. Pairing these walks with journaling may be a good idea too. Having a “walk journal” that records any new ideas that come while walking. It's probably best to write any ideas down immediately after the walk so they don't slip away.</p>
                    <h3>Week 5: Look at yourself</h3>
                    <p>We need to look at ourselves and see if our actions are complicating our relationships? Sorted relationships and peaceful life inspire creativity. So, we need to take a break from our hectic schedule. Create a relaxed state by breathing deeply, stretching, going for a walk, listening to music or whatever that works for us. Once relaxed, we might find a creative answer to a problem that has been eluding you.</p>
                    <h3>Week 6: Spend time with tourself</h3>
                    <p>Time spent with ourselves are the best times for creative inputs. This week and from now on, let's give a dedicated time when we are with nature or with ourselves. Some of the best ideas come to us during these walks with nature. Pairing these walks with  journaling may be a good idea too. Having a “walk journal” that records any new ideas that come while walking. It's probably best to write any ideas down immediately after the walk, so they don't slip away.</p>
                    <h3>Week 7: Reach out</h3>
                    <p>Reach out to people with similar interests and have lively conversations. Collective pursuits inspire us during the times we are alone and help ignite our creativity further. A mixture of solitude and collaboration that keeps us creative in art.</p>
                    <h3>Week 8: Be consistent</h3>
                    <p>We need to give ourselves time to foster creativity and not be too judgemental about it. Be consistent, giving space to trial and error. Having faith that it will grow into something very beautiful.</p>
