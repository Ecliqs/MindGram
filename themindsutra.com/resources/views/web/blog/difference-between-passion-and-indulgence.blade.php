                <p>As Mark Manson shares in 'The subtle art of not giving a fuck, "For most of my adolescence and young adulthood, I fantasized about being a musician- rockstar. Despite my fantasizing for over half my life time, the reality never came to fruition. And it took me a longtime and struggle to finally figure out why I didn't actually want it.</p>
                <p>I was in love with the result - the image of me on the stage,people cheering me rocking out, but I wasn't in love with the process. And because of that, I failed at it. Repeatedly. I wanted the reward and not the struggle. Who you are is defined by what you are willing to struggle for.This is the simple and basic component of our life: our struggles determine our successes."</p>
                <p>What all of us most want - is to be able to comfortably love and nurture ourselves, we want others to care for us the way we want them to care for us.But that's what all of us want.  What we don't realise is that self nurture is not about comfort but about our ability to tolerate pain and even enjoy it to be able to reap the rewards. We cannot choose to withdraw from the upward climb for self nurturing as 'the joy is in the climb itself,' as Mark Manson would add.</p>
                <p>Most of us are not ready to pay the price of following our truth.</p>
                <p>What is so unfortunate about self-indulgent (vs. self-nurturing and choosing apparent pain ) behavior is that at bottom it represents a misguided effort to bolster positive feelings about the self. So how is it that so many of us canâ€™t seem to distinguish between these two modes of dealing with our deepest wants and needs?</p>
