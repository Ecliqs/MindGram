                <p>In Shrimad Bhagavatam, Yudhisthira ,talking to Krishna about conducting Aswamegh Yagna, says, “When we have you as our guardian, You with your inexhaustible Grace,why should I worry about anything? When we have the Kalpataru ( Wish fulfilling tree) in my garden, why should I worry, seeking tubers and roots?The all-powerful Lord who has been guarding us all these years as the eyelids guard the eye, will not give us up, at this juncture.</p>
                <p>You are my Treasure,my treasury. You are the Very Breath. All my strength, all my  wealth is you and you alone... I place all my burdens on Your feet. You can do anything you like. I am equally happy, whatever you do. It is your will, not mine.”</p>
                <p>Living our life with this level of surrender takes  away a lot of stresses from our life.</p>
