                <p>In the world today, we often find ourselves lost and tired because of the dissipation of our energies and attention all the time. We end up spending our energy and time at places and in thoughts which exhausts us. The day is gone before it starts. Most activities don't leave us with a greater sense of peace or joy compared to the way they started.</p>
                <p>David Goggins believes that most human beings are only living at about 40% of their capabilities. Whenever we pursue a goal , we may be discouraged by the negative self talk. Our mind controls us. Whenever, we reach the uncomfortable or the unfamiliar zone or feel the pain , we react with a flight or fright response and the mind pushes us back into our comfort zone. It is at this moment if we could prompt the mind to stop and continue with what we had decided , we have crossed a barrier within or raised the bar for ourselves. And it is about repsâ€¦repetition of that positive motivating behaviour. It is about making it a habit.  During these times, we may need someone to watch us and show us the mirror, inspire us, when we are about to give up. The feeling of accomplishment or exhilaration is amazing. It raises our confidence and prompts us to achieve newer accomplishments. It pushes us to live our lives more fully.</p>
                <p>Looking back, Meghna and I realize that medical college life was all about tapas. During these most productive years of our lives, we had no time to distract ourselves.</p>
                <p>During my student days, I remember when I was studying intensely, I remember feeling as if the time would expand and I could finish studying topics that I thought couldn't be done in that little time. It was as if the Universe would conspire to help me at those times when I was in sync with it. Whenever we push ourselves to do our best, we probably tap into some unknown resource of the Universe which then works to make things work for us.</p>
