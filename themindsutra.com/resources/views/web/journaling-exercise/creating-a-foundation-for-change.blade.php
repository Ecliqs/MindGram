                    <p>This is an absolute travesty in the name of medical care and patient support, but this is also the Simpsons we’re talking about. The sheer inadequacy of palliative care aside, something else in this exchange is worth a second thought. You’ve very likely heard of the five stages of grief – it  also comes up in an episode of “The Office”, for those of you who are more familiar with that show. Basically, pop Psychology’s had a field day with this one. The idea first came from Elizabeth Kubler-Ross, a Swiss-American Psychiatrist in the 1960s. For a long time, she’d consistently spent the tail end of her medical shift with people with terminal diagnoses waiting to die, and slowly observed consistent themes in the way they processed drastic changes like their terminal illness. In her 1969 book <i>On Death and Dying: What the Dying have to teach Doctors, Nurses, Clergy and their own Families</i>, Kubler-Ross first delineates her groundbreaking five stages of grief, that would later come to be generalized to people dealing with the realities of the death of their loved ones. Soon enough, the model began to be widely applied to any kind of major change – organizational/industrial psychologists famously adapted the idea for use in workplaces as well, to ease employees into organizational change.</p>
                    <p>Lets jump right in and lay out exactly what these stages look like, and what they each entail, with an example that I’m reasonably sure all of us relate with in some way. The COVID-19 pandemic fits the bill perfectly – it has had a whole host of negative outcomes for most people. The first step is denial: you refuse what’s in front of you, you insist there’s got to be some mistake somewhere, and you seek alternate, more palatable explanations. A pandemic in this day and age? This can’t be happening, somebody’s probably hyped up the whole thing, and I’m not going to buy into this. I’m going to carry on with my routine same as if nothing had happened. Denial in optimum amounts (which would be very small amounts) is actually healthy, as Psychologist and psychological trauma expert Ronnie Janoff-Bulman explains. It is the brain’s way of dosing itself, the way one would take painkillers during and after surgery to help with immediate and excruciating pain. As the pain subsides, so would the usage of painkillers.</p>
                    <p>The second stage is anger and frustration: this largely entails envy and resentment, as one looks outwards, gets concrete conformation that the change is indeed real,  and reevaluates one’s changed circumstances from that certainty. There are also persistent ideas of why things couldn’t have been this or that way instead. This stage is perhaps easier to grasp in the context of more individual and less global changes, because it often involves questions like “why me?”, but sentiments like “why can’t I meet up with friends, graduate properly, go socialize at my workplace like other people got to do before me” exemplify this state of being. This stage takes some time to process and get out of one’s system, and might also  involve regressing to the stage of denial to try to cope better.</p>
                    <p>Next comes bargaining: if only I did this, that or the other, I could make this better. That’s the kind of thinking that characterizes bargaining – you bargain with doctors, religious figures, God or whoever else you think could make your situation better. The basic premise of this stage is to buy time, to keep from accepting the change as it comes. Thoughts like “if I and my loved ones make it through Corona, I’ll be a better, more understanding person, I’ll value life more when it isn’t on the verge of being snatched away from me” demonstrate bargaining to cope with change. This stage is contested in later adaptations of this model – the 7-stage model of change, for instance, gets rid of this stage altogether and institutes other stages in the final part of the curve instead.</p>
                    <p>We now reach the lowest point in the curve – the depressive stage. This involves loss of confidence in ones abilities, a sense of powerlessness and loss of control over one’s own life outcomes, a dip in one’s sense of self-worth, and a heavy impact on one’s self-concept. Things like losing contact with loved ones, or losing one’s job, or one’s general outlook on life being affected because of the logistical trouble posed by the pandemic both contributes to and draws from the depressive stage -  it’s a vicious cycle. Denial and/or anger are very likely stages to regress too at this point.</p>
                    <p>Originally, Kubler-Ross jumped straight from depression to acceptance, but later models (like the 7-stage model mentioned earlier) institute the intermediary stages of experimentation, and decision-making and planning that lead eventually to acceptance. Acceptance in the original 1969 model comprised a dawning sense of self-discovery, a desire to see the change through, and re-evaluation and positive planning to set and achieve newly-set goals, accompanied by a recovered sense of stability and confidence. In terms of our example, it would entail a recovered sense of comfort and confidence with respect to the pandemic situation – one learns to accept distancing norms as they are, and learns to establish new routines and habits to recover a sense of camaraderie and closeness with people, as well as one’s professional aplomb under the altered circumstances</p>
                    <p>This model still retains its appeal after half a century of its inception because it was one of the first substantial steps in the direction of palliative care (psychological or otherwise) as we know it today. It meant something to give form to the formlessness that was grief and resistance to change. What is paramount to remember, and Kubler-Ross concurs with this in her later writing, is that these stages aren’t navigated in a linear fashion, and further research suggests that neither are they all compulsory to pass through in order to reach acceptance – one could skip over some stages, experience others that don’t make an appearance on Kubler-Ross’s curve at all, etc. These are merely loose guidelines, not map directions by any means. As Psychologist David B. Feldman, PhD also explains, grief is more a rollercoaster of emotions than a neat set of stages – we can’t all follow the same yellow brick road to the emerald city.</p>
                    <p>Kubler-Ross’s research is also contested on various other grounds – that her sample size for the experiment that catalysed these five stages into being was little more than 200 people, for one. But for the purposes of the expressive writing exercise, we can draw from the Kubler-Ross model. We don’t have to treat these as linear signposts in our journey towards acceptance of change – merely treating them as prompts to galvanise thinking and introspection would also help to harness its therapeutic effects. Grief is often amorphous and undefinable, and language and semantics fail us at the best of times when dealing with nebulous ideas like grief. These stages could act as starting points to try to make sense of one’s own experiences and to locate oneself in one’s journey towards acceptance. It also helps to attempt to figure out ways to advance through the stages towards acceptance, as one continues writing. Acting on the results of understanding of one’s own position gives us something concrete to do to ease ourselves through the grieving process, an anchor of sorts to hold on to and be guided by in the midst of our psychological maelstroms. That said, it is also important to celebrate one’s successes as we move forward from one stage to the next – writing about how one will reward oneself for the progress made is also an exercise in positive reinforcement. We eventually start to link the process of self-discovery that accompanies writing with positive outcomes as we gradually move forward through the stages. That makes the exercise even more rewarding. Remember the flip-out rule mentioned in the Introduction to Expressive Writing episode, however. Do not write about something that you don’t feel ready for yet, especially not if the incident in question has occurred within 2-3 weeks and is still very fresh.</p>
