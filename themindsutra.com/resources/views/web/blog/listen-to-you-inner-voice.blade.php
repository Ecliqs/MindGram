                <p>How much help you get, from higher intelligence, depends on how big your plans are. The bigger your plans are - meaning... how many people will benefit - the more help you will qualify for.- Jose Silva</p>
                <p>Having a vision is necessary. It helps us get alignment. The world in its general state is very chaotic with many different things going on at different places at the same time. A vision attracts our dreams and the opportunities we want to work on towards us and gives alignment in this chaotic world. Think of the world like a giant jumbled jigsaw puzzle. The bigger the vision we have and the more we are aligned internally, the more this jigsaw puzzle starts to solve and makes our dreams into reality.</p>
                <p>'To choose as we will' obviously does not mean that we do not hear our inner voice. We should remember that whatever we desire should be aligned to our life purpose. On February 19, 2010, Tiger Woods gave a televised statement in which again apologized for his indulgences and infidelities. "I thought I could get away with whatever I wanted to," he said. "I felt that I had worked hard my entire life and deserved to enjoy all the temptations around me. I felt I was entitled. Thanks to money and fame, I didn't have to go far to find them. I was wrong. I was foolish."</p>
                <p>Had Tiger Woods heard his inner voice, he could have prevented the tsunami that hit his life hard.</p>
