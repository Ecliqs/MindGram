                <p>In 2011, Arunima Sinha was thrown out of a running train, suffered serious injuries including loss of her leg, a rod inserted in the other leg and multiple spine fractures. That is when she decided to pursue mountaineering and climb Mt. Everest. She says as she reached the top, she wanted to shout from the top and tell all those people who give up in life that "No, you can do everything, It's all how you think! A person is handicapped only [physically] not from the [mind]. If a person is handicapped from the [mind], then normal people are handicapped too who are handicapped in the [mind]."</p>
                <p>Today, we need to evaluate our actions and choices that give us immediate or transient pleasures and see if we would like to exchange those choices for a richer and more meaningful life. Each time I hear Arunima Sinha ,the first Indian amputee to climb the Mount Everest, Kilimanjaro in Africa, Elbrus in Europe, Kosciuszko in Australia, Aconcagua in Argentina and Carstensz Pyramid in Indonesia, I feel the goosebumps on me. When we put in our heroic best  to achieve our goals, the Universe notices them and rewards us with unexpected gifts.</p>
