                <p> It is wrong on our part to have preconceived notions of mistrust. We need to be aware of the influences of the belief systems we adopt and cleanse ourselves of the judgmental thoughts and be as kids are. Young children are pure - loving, truthful, open and transparent. We need to cleanse our hearts so that we are so full of love, joy, and trust.</p>
                <p>When I was in my early twenties, I had a dream about a girl wearing a beautiful, white silk flowing gown stepping out in her town on Holi, the festival of colours. As she walks into the crowd playing Holi, she gets colored by the colors that people sprinkle on her. She struggles to move out of the crowd but she cannot. Try hard as she might, she cannot find a speck of white on her clothes.</p>
                <p>The dream came back to me when I was thinking about Shauch. If we do not protect our inner selves in the world as we move out, we get colored by peopleâ€™s convictions, expectations, and beliefs. We adopt, accept their beliefs and convictions as our own and stop responding to our inner GPS to direct our lives.</p>
                <p>In the movie The Matrix actor Keanu Reeves plays the character Neo. He changes the way he thinks about himself. He goes from being a skeptic about his own capabilities to become a true believer that even the unthinkable is doable. Purity is about being a "believing Neo" - a super force beyond our wildest dreams. If we could just be simple enough to believe in this power within us. , we could achieve the unthinkable.</p>
                <p>Integrity means standing by our word in everything we do. Indian culture is filled with stories of people giving up their lives for their word. Lord Rama went to the forest for the sake of his father's word to Kaikeyi. Bhishma Pitamah stood by the Kauravs during the war as he had given his word to his father. It takes a lot of guts and inner strength to stand for our truth.</p>
