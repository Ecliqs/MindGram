                <p>On an African safari with my family, our guide instructed us on how to react, in case we came face-to-face with a lion, "The first thing you do when you come across a growling lion is freeze and avert your eyes. If you see stalking indications, then raise your arms above your head and wave them. If you have something in your hand then throw it at the lion. Even if the lion charges you do not run."</p>
                <p>This coaching ahead of a South African safari made me think how animals can instinctively read our thoughts and do not attack people who have the presence of mind.</p>
                <p>Shauch, or Purity means purification or cleansing. While cleansing of our external environment and body is a daily routine for most of us, cleansing our internal organs, thoughts and attitude is something we do not give due importance to.</p>
