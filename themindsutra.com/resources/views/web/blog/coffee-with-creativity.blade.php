                <p>As the Covid pandemic seemed to be phasing off, a local club called,” Coffee with Creativity” , got together to recognize the contributions of people who fought the lockdown and its medical, economic and social repercussions with creativity.</p>
                <p>The awardees narrated stories of the numerous creative ways, through which they had helped others by being productive during Covid despite personal challenges. They spoke of creating new art, of cooking new exotic dishes, learning music and dance, and finding creative ways of providing food and medicines to the needy in spite of the lockdown. There was joy on the faces reminiscing about it and a sense of contentment. The challenges and difficult times that the pandemic had entailed had left no traces on them. When we celebrate what we have, instead of worrying about what we have lost, we feel tremendous joy and fulfillment within us.</p>
