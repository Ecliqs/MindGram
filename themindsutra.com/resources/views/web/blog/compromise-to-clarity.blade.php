                <p>There were a few years when I wasn't connecting within. Following directions or fulfilling expectations was my only GPS. I was a shadow of myself in those years of my life. Those were difficult years as I couldn't justify my actions to myself. Looking back, I realize acceptance is a choice, compromise is not. Compromise is against our inner will. And truth pops out its face , sooner or later.</p>
                <p>We need to remember that our truth is fluid. Our truth evolves as we grow. Now I consciously stop myself from indulging in small white lies of compromise, that snatch a moment for myself. That does not mean I am being selfish. In fact, I have become more selfless as compromise started to give way to clarity of not just my thoughts, feelings and actions, but that of others.</p>
                <p>The balancing act of giving selflessly and retaining with clarity is the real art of yog and psychology.</p>
