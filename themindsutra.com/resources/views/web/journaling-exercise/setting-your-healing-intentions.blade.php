                    <h2>Setting your healing intentions</h2>
                    <p>Setting out to do the expressive writing exercise is a little like starting a workout routine. You aren’t exactly bursting with motivation to start, they’re both demanding exercises that are uncomfortable and/or even painful in the beginning, but both generally yield positive and rewarding outcomes in the long-term. That’s how Dr. Thomas Smithyman, who is a practising psychologist and one of the co-hosts of the Anxious in Austin’s Podcast, describes it after having been a longtime expressive-writer himself. Expressive writing can be temporarily unpleasant in the beginning because you are metaphorically poking at a sore place, trying to identify the source of the problem, but the exercise also gets positively reinforced with time, which is to say that you become keener on continuing it because you progressively start to associate it with positive, feel-good outcomes as time goes by. Once you’ve determined you want to try out expressive writing, it would help to know a few things about how to start out – that’s what I plan to address in this video.</p>
                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-md-6 mb-3">
                            <p>The very first step is to work towards identifying what you want to write about – in other words, to recognise what is bothering you and consequently what it is that you want to heal. It might be a daunting task to try to put your finger on it exactly, but it is generally a promising start, and a straightforward one at that,  to commence your search from things that keep you awake at night. Start writing about the emotional upheavals that keep you up at night, and your deepest thoughts and feelings associated with them. Remember that what you write is for yourself alone, that it isn’t meant to be shared at all, unless your therapist assigns you the writing for purposes of therapeutic analysis, in which case your therapist is the only person who has access to what you write. Destroy what you right, if that is something that increases your level of comfort with the exercise – Dr. Smithyman does it because it makes him feel better and more secure about what he’s putting into words, whereas Dr. Marianne Stout (another practising psychologist and the co-host of the podcast) preserves all her journals because it helps her look back on times when she made it through emotionally-charged situations in the past. This helps her gain perspective on emotional upheavals in the present by juxtaposing them with events in the past, and also makes it possible for her to look back on coping strategies she’s used. Do what feels comfortable for you, the crux of the matter is the process of meaning-making that accompanies writing, which is equally possible whether you retain or destroy your writing.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>Another important thing to remember is to go with where your writing takes you, provided it doesn’t stray away to someplace like what’s cooking for dinner, of course. You might start off with writing about a particular event and then make linkages with other events or people etc, which is perfectly alright and even desirable. This just means, as Psychologist Eugenio Duarte points out, that you are beginning to integrate your troubling event into your life – digesting it, as it were, to make it easier to deal with. In the course of this process, patterns might start to appear in your concerns and preoccupations, which would further help to figure out your healing intentions. Some psychologists also believe it is helpful to draw, doodle or scribble alongside the writing process, as these can potentially act as prompts to your unconscious mind to zoom in on what it is that needs healing.</p>
                    <p>Part of what the writing process eventually accomplishes is to change the way you think of your emotionally-troubling event, and to change your reaction to it. This is essentially like what cognitive therapy sets out to accomplish – it endeavours to change the beliefs that act as intermediaries between actions (or events in this case) and their physical, behavioural or psychological consequences within oneself. Expressive writing (or therapy, for that matter) can’t change the way we experience events, it can only work on our responses to them and our beliefs that shape those responses. Expressive writing is for two kinds of people, as Dr. Pennebaker reiterates multiple times across his scholarly work – the first are people who are going through a difficult time and are looking for ways to work through it, and the second are those who are curious about expressive writing and how it works. The effects of the process, Dr. Pennebaker continues, are modest (and consistently so) across cultures and circumstances. If you’re one of those two types of people, why not give it a go? Expressive writing is relatively easy to incorporate into routine, reasonably accessible to most people, and inexpensive, at that. We include a list of resources about the things we’ve been talking about in the video, so that you can learn more about anything that interests you that we couldn’t expand on.

                            <p>Dr. Smithyman and Dr. Stout have a highly engaging conversation about expressive writing in episode 14 of their Anxious in Austin’s Podcast titled “Write yourself Healthy: A Discussion of Expressive Writing”. They talk about their personal and professional experiences with the exercise, and also take us through recent research on the subject.
