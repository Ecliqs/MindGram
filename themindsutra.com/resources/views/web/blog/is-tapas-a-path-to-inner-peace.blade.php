                <p>But the bigger or rather, the practical question to answer is - “Is tapas a path to inner peace or higher consciousness for people of the world with jobs and families to take care of, who cannot withdraw from the world to go to the Himalayas or retreats, go?”</p>
                <p>The answer is Yes. Just the way Tapas is implemented, changes. Once Maa Sharda, wife of Ramkrishna Paramhansa, was asked how she manages to do her meditation or sadhna while taking care of an entire ashram. She replied that she does not need to take time off her work to practise meditation. She would just chant japas or remember the name of Goddess Kali, while doing her daily chores like cooking, cleaning and washing. She said in fact the hard work she put in, with complete dedication  to take care of the ashram and the one lakh japas she did with complete devotion, while completing her chores purified her very being, just as any meditation would do.</p>
