                <p>Our life is governed by the law of attraction. According to Esther Hicks and Jerry Hicks, rather than using the term the Cosmic Law of Attraction, the term The Law of Resonance may be closer to the truth. In order to understand this law it's important to first understand that everything in this Universe is made up of energy and has its own vibrational frequency.</p>
                <p>If we want to attract something we need to be at the same vibrational frequency as what we want. The Law of Resonance states that anything that is on the same vibrational frequency makes itself known to each other. They vibrate on the same frequency. When we send out signals on a certain frequency through our thoughts and emotions the universe responds to us with anything and everything that resonates with that frequency.</p>
                <p>Hence we should learn to resonate with what we want instead of resonating with what we are doubtful of, fearful of and so on. When we do that our thoughts and emotions will manifest what we want in life. â€˜Imagine that the Universe is like a Cosmic Kitchen with an Infinite Menu, just waiting to take and fulfill our orders! extols Louis Hay.We need to declare our needs to the Universe, surrendering completely to the Universe, knowing whatever shall be served is the best for us.</p>
