                <p>In this amazing one-off documentary Dangerous knowledge, David Malone looks at four brilliant mathematicians whose genius has profoundly affected us, but which tragically drove them insane and eventually led to them all committing suicide because their life’s work was not accepted and they were ostracised by the scientific societies of their time.</p>
                <p>As a therapist, I come across people with these conflicts every day. What choice does a young mother make who wants to go back to work but her husband and in-laws are not supportive? What choice does a transgender ‘male’ nurse make who really wants to be a ‘female’ model, but risks losing claim to family inheritance on doing so. What choice does a breadwinner make who is dissatisfied with his corporate job but has a household to run and his kid's college fees to pay?</p>
                <p>There are no right or wrong choices here. But, there is a choice to truly accept or truly stand up for one's truth.</p>
                <p>The balancing act of Satya (truth) and Ahimsa (no harm to oneself and others) is the real science of yog and psychology.</p>
