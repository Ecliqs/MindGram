                <p>The word tapas means "fire".  The day we ignite the inner fire, we are a beacon of light inspiring the world to find their own fire. She knew that if she was disciplined and pushed herself enough, she could achieve the unachievable.</p>
                <p>Amit, Shaifali's husband, started taking cold showers with a bucket filled with ice throughout the year. Every mug of the ice chilled water was exhilarating and gave him a sense of achievement of having pushed his limits and found himself to  mentally alert and relaxed for the day.Today, we need to evaluate our actions and choices that give us immediate or transient pleasures and see if we would like to exchange those choices for a richer and more meaningful life. Each time I hear Arunima Sinha ,the first Indian amputee to climb the Mount Everest, Kilimanjaro in Africa, Elbrus in Europe, Kosciuszko in Australia, Aconcagua in Argentina and Carstensz Pyramid in Indonesia, I feel the goosebumps on me. When we put in our heroic best  to achieve our goals, the Universe notices them and rewards us with unexpected gifts.</p>
                <p>Bhaag Milkha Bhaag", the Olympian's biopic was a life-changing film for many, inspiring all with the numerous inspirational and motivational messages scattered throughout the film. Beautifully depicting his blood and sweat that made him the champion that he was, the film  starts out by showing him seriously working out and wringing his sweat in a mug  and then graduating to the bucket. His coach inspires him saying that a sportsperson needs Jazbaat ( Passion), Discipline, Tapasya ( Penance).</p>
