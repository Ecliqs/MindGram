                <p>I had met Amit only once before we decided to get married. I was doing my residency in Anaesthesiology at Mumbai. He stayed in a different city and had come to meet me responding to a matrimonial column advertisement in the newspaper. I even decided to leave MD anaesthesiology which I was pursuing at that moment of time and shift to a different city. At that time, it seemed the right thing to do.</p>
                <p>I did not have an answer to many questions.I had no idea if I could secure specialisation if I had discontinued it in Mumbai. I did not know anything about Amit or his family. Amit had just completed his post graduation and was planning to start his practice.</p>
                <p>My parents were not sure if this was the right thing to do and had their own apprehensions. But, whenever I spoke to my inner voice it felt right, it felt beautiful. I needed no other assurance. I knew then that it had to be that way.</p>
