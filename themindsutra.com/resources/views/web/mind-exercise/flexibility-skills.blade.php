                    <p>Ahimsa is the first and most important of the Yamas. Ahimsa basically implies regulating our negativity and being completely in love with self, others and life.</p>
                    <h3>Mind fitness exercise for Self-responsibility:</h3>
                    <p>Assertion exercise Loving and protecting ourselves matters. If we don't love and protect ourselves, we will not be able to love others. When irritated, angry or hurt, look deeper within yourself instead of blaming others or life. Become aware of yourself-talk. Now, practise assertive techniques for problem solving. For instance, using ‘I understand but I expect’ messaging.</p>
                    <h3>Mind fitness exercise for Empathy:</h3>
                    <p>Anger management exercise This week select someone with whom you would like to work on your relationship. Write down things about the person that anger you. Now, write down things you like about that person. When you talk, try your best to accept the part you don’t like and remind yourself of the part you like. Take their point of view in the conversation. Listen first, talk later. Begin your conversation by saying, ’I understand.’ If you start to get angry during the conversation, time-out (when you are not angry, the other person is in a better position to listen to you). Does your capacity to hold conversations with them increase by taking their perspective? Does it make your relationship more functional?</p>
                    <h3>Mind fitness exercise for Courage:</h3>
                    <p>Face your Fears Pro-active courage: Ahimsa requires us to challenge our fears and cross the boundaries we have erected for ourselves. What are those areas I can cross my boundaries of fear, I have created for myself? For this week, pick up one fear to work upon. Expose yourselves to that fear in gradual gradation over the week. Share your small victories.</p>
                    <h3>Mind fitness exercise for psychological flexibility:</h3>
                    <p>Acknowledge the fact that we are all fallible, complex and changing. Think about an event that led to strong negative emotion or behaviour. Was this emotion or behaviour helpful? What is the underlying thought or belief leading to that emotion? Now, create a thought challenge like a lawyer prosecuting this negative thought. Challenge your negative thoughts. Reframe it in a more constructive manner. Look at your own capacity for psychological flexibility with curiosity and kindness.</p>
                    <p>Understanding anger and anger management would come first. What angers me ? or irritates me ? What are the triggers throughout the day? This week select someone that you would like to work on your relationship with. When you talk, try your best to take their point of view. Does your capacity to feel empathy change by taking their perspective? Develop your listening and empathy skills by making a conscious effort to fact-check your interpretations and assumptions regarding what they said. During a conversation, start by giving your full attention to the other person.</p>
                    <h3>Mind fitness exercise for Proactive courage:</h3>
                    <p>Ahimsa requires us to challenge our fears and cross those boundaries we have erected for ourselves. What are those areas I can cross my boundaries of fear I have created for myself? What are those areas in my life that I can do differently? How can my actions help me dream higher and surprise myself?</p>
                    <p>Acknowledging the fact that we are not our emotions.Talking about them to a friend, or family without being afraid of judgment. Look at your own reactions to their judgements with curiosity and kindness.</p>
